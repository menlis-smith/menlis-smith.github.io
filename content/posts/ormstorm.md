# Welcome to ORMStorm

ORMStorm is a small library for easy work with databases.

## The key features are:

 - **Simplicity:** The library is very simple, and it won't take long to learn it.
 - **Coding speed:** Integrating the library into your projects won't take long.
 - **Dynamic:** Unlike others, this library will allow you to very quickly create new tables and add databases to them.

## Installing

    pip install ormstorm
   
## Usage

Using standard tables

```python
from ormstorm import Table, Types, Column, create_session  


class ExampleTable(Table): 
    __tablename__ = "example"  
      
    id = Column(Types.INTEGER, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)  
    text = Column(Types.STRING)  
      
      
LocalSession = create_session("example.sqlite3", [ExampleTable])  
      
with LocalSession() as session:  
    session.insert(ExampleTable(text="Hello, world!"))
```

Using a dynamic table

```python
from ormstorm import DynamicTable, Types, Column, create_session  
      
      
LocalSession = create_session("example.sqlite3", [])  
      
with LocalSession() as session:  
    NewTable = DynamicTable(  
        "new_table", {"id": Column(Types.INTEGER, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True), "text": Column(Types.STRING)}  
    )  
      
    session.create(NewTable)  
    session.insert(NewTable(text="Easy use of dynamic tables!"))
```

## Magic filters

Magic filters is a special system that allows you to quickly write conditions for sql queries in the usual python style!
Magic filters currently support the following operators: `=`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `&`, `|`, `~`

Simple use of magic filters:

```python
from ormstorm import Table, Types, Column, create_session


class ExampleTable(Table):
    __tablename__ = "example"

    id = Column(Types.INTEGER, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    text = Column(Types.STRING)


LocalSession = create_session("example.sqlite3", [ExampleTable])

with LocalSession() as session:
    result = session.select(
        (ExampleTable.text == "Hello") | ((ExampleTable.id > 5) & (ExampleTable.id < 15))
    )
```

Instead of the usual `and` and `or`, `&` and `|` are used, respectively. Also, `~` is used instead of the `or` keyword.
It is also worth noting that some expressions should be wrapped in parentheses to avoid unexpected errors.

To select all data from a table, simply specify its class.

```python
result = session.select(ExampleTable)
```
